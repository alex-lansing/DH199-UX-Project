## Heuristic Evaluation
### 10 Usability Heuristics
Heuristic evaluation is a method that helps creators identify usability problens in a product design. The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://medium.muz.li/10-tips-on-how-to-conduct-a-perfect-heuristic-evaluation-ae5f8f4b3257) provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process. This evaluation will analyze La Historia Museum's [current website](https://www.lahistoriamuseum.org).

### Severity Ratings
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Sevarity ratings for the La Historia Museum website will be measured on a scale of 0-3:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Application indicates to users what lesson they are on at the top left of the screen. This allows users to keep track of their progress through the site. Further, in the interactive beat and sound making tasks, the status of each feature is shown by highlighted segments. When beats are selected, they remain highlighted to demonstrate to users which beats and instruments are active in the song. |**Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic changes could be made to indicate better the status of user's progress through the lessons. | Create a visual indication of user's progress through the lessons at the bottom of each lesson page. For example, create a horizontal bar that fills as user completes more tasks. |
| Match Between System and Real World | Icons of features are based off of general knowledge. "Play" buttons use the standard play icon that users can recognize from past experiences. Toggle options for adjusting tempo are familiar to users and function of these toggles is direct and clear. However, in the bars lesson, the clickable options for different bars is not as familiar with users. The option to select these bars is not clear. | **Severity Rating: 2** Minor adjustments needed to indicate that users are able to select different bar options. These selections are not as familiar to users because they do not look like familiar clickable buttons/options. Icons used are clear and recognizable and do not need to be altered. | Design the bar selections to look like clickable features that users are familiar with. For example, create more contrast between the bar selections and the background div, so the selections look more like clickable buttons. |
| User Control and Freedom | Users are presented multiple options for beats and sounds in the interactive tasks. They are able to undo and clear their selections, and create unique combinations of music features. However, there is no redo option if users clear their selections. | **Severity Rating: 2** Users are unable to redo their selections if they clear their choices. This limits user control and freedom because they are unable to experiment multiple combinations of music features without erasing past work. | Provide an option for users to redo if they clear their work. Further, provide users the option to save their work. One possible suggestion for this is creating a user login, where different profiles can store saved projects. |
| Consistency and Standards | Design is mostly consistent with other preexisting applications. Buttons indicate selection when they are highlighted, help pop-ups are familiar to the user, and standard arrows direct the user to the next lesson. However, the ability to drag and select multiple buttons at once is unclear. These selections are only displayed by plain rectangular buttons; there is no indication that you can select multiple at a time by dragging. | **Severity Rating: 1** Icons are consistent with existing applications and they remain the same throughout the design of the website. Cosmetic changes needed for indicating to the user that they can drag and select multiple buttons at a time when selecting beats and sounds. | Change the design of the beat and sound buttons from plain rectangles to rectangles with a drag indication towards the right. This could be in the form of a small grey bar. This would indicate (in a consistent and familiar way) that users can click and drag across the screen if they want to select multiple buttons at a time. |
| Error Prevention | User is provided with a "Fill in solution" option that will clear incorrect selections and complete tasks with the correct solution. "Reset" options are available at the top of every task, which will clear all selections and revert back to the original set-up if users want to restart. | **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic improvements could be made to help direct users from creating errorful selections. For example, the site could provide more initial visualizations of different sound and beat combinations. However, help pop-ups direct users in tasks throughout the site, and show-solution buttons are offered for the complicated tasks. | Error prevention is relatively strong in this site due to the show-solution options for tasks, reset options, and help pop-ups. The design could reduce users' errorful music combinations by providing more visual examples of beat and sound combinations. Users could be able to select these combinations and use them on their own template, so they can experiment with the examples given. |
| Recognition Rather than Recall | Users are provided with clear selections labeled appropriately. Menu items are shown in a drop down to the left of the screen, allowing the user to easily access their current lesson and other lessons when needed. | **Severity Rating: 1** Elements, actions, and options are clearly visible to the user. The user is able to keep track of what lesson they are on, what task they are completing, and what selections they have made. Cosmetic edits could be made to help the user undertand better what part of the lesson they are on since there are several lessons with numerous chapters. | Next to the lesson number indicated at the top left of the page, provide the title of the main lesson that users are currently on. This would allow useres to track their progress more smoothly instead of having to click on the menu every time to see where they are at. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users are able to execute tasks with keyboard shortcuts. As seen in the Beats lesson, users have the option to switch "Keyboard ON" or "Keyboard OFF", which allows users to select options with the number keys on their keyboard. However, this keyboard shortcut is only available in a limited set of tasks. This shortcut is not available for the main tasks of selecting beats and sounds.| **Severity Rating: 2** Users have limited ability to create keyboard shortcuts when selecting beats and sounds. | Include the keyboard shortcut for beat and sound selection tasks. The number keys could correspond to the selections, making the application more accessible for multiple users. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Design of the website is somewhat simple, but many clickable options can be confusing for the user. The menu can be accessed by both the menu icon and "Chapters" icon, which is redundant in the design. All buttons for music features are designed with the same shape and color, which is simple, but distinguising the features from one another might be executed better with different colors. | **Severity Rating: 2** Design includes some redundant features that could be fixed with minor adjustments. Music feature selections are indistinguishable without the text, and are not as aethetic as could be possible. | Menu icon could be referenced only once at the top of the page. This would limit redundancy and allow users to more easily navigate to different lessons and chapters. The buttons could be colored differently in order to demonstrate the difference between each music feature being selected. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | Users are provided with help pop-ups throughout each lesson that instruct users how to use the task features and fix issues if errorful selections are made. | **Severity Rating: 1** If user makes an error there is indication for how to fix the problem. Difficulties are predicted beforehand and help pop-ups help users avoid these issues. | Little improvement needed in this area. Possible cosmetic changes could be made to make the help pop-ups more visible for users. Users should also be able to re-view the help suggestions once they disappear. |
| Help and Documentation | Further instructions are provided in the "Where to go from here" option. Users are also able to view more information in the "Go to Ableton.com" option. Help pop-ups direct users consistently throughout all lessons. |  **Severity Rating: 1** Cosmetic changes could be made where users are able to view help for each lesson when desired (even after the pop-up disappears). Further instructions and information are sufficiently visible and accessible. | Provide an Info button that displays help information for each task, so users can access suggestions at any point in their work. Make the "Go to Ableton.com" option more visible in the Menu bar. An FAQ section could also be provided for further information for users. |


## Planning User Research
The purpose of this user research is to understand the major pain points users might experience in La Historia's current website. Findings will help identify the changes and features needed to improve the site.
