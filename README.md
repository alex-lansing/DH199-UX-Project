## Planning User Research

### Research Question
La Historia Museum aims to connect with its community by engaging with visitors, donors, and staff. How can we enhance this engagement through an online experience that is usable, accessible, and representative of the organization?

### Objectives
- Identify the reasons why and how often visitors and community members use the La Historia website.
- Explore web-based features that visitors feel would enhance their interactions with the organization.
- Discover any pain points in navigating the website (for visitors) and updating the website (for staff members), while being cognizant of accessibility and different familiarities with technology.
- Contextualize the website and the La Historia Museum within its organizational and community histories to explore how to center El Monteâ€™s identities (race, gender, ethnicity, ability, etc..) in our design.


### Methodology
The methodology of this study explores how we can enhance community engagement with La Historia Museum via their website. We will aggregate quantitative and qualitative research aimed to identify improvements needed on the current site. Research will consist of a Heuristic Evaluation, Competitor Analysis, Usability Testing, and 5-second Tests. The Usability Test tasks will be measured with the quantitative metrics: Average Time on Task (TOT), Success Rate, and Number of Errors. The 5-Second Tests will record users' first impressions of important pages on the museum website and help us evaluate museum-community engagement. 

The target user includes individuals located in or near El Monte, California. Target users have some interest in visiting museums and value local history. They are of various age groups, and mainly of Hispanic or Native American descent. We will focus on recruiting participants that fall under most or all these criteria. Participants do not need any particular level of expertise for this study. Participants should include individuals with varying tech experience.

The data from each test will be analyzed to identify improvements for the design of the user experience. From my findings I hope to understand how digital experiences can enhance the connection between the user and an organization. What encourages users to engage, to get involved? Further, I aim to identify effective design solutions from this research and demonstrate them in an illustrative prototype.


### Usability Test
This is an unmoderated, remote usability test. It will be conducted via Google Forms and Lookback. 

Google Forms will present an introduction, informed consent form, and background questions to the user. Then it will direct the user to a Lookback link. Lookback will present three tasks to the user. This platform will guide participants through the tasks and record participant actions as they use the website. Participants will have the option to turn off their camera, but their voice and screen will be recorded. After completing the tasks, the user will be prompted to close out and return to the Google Form. The form will present a post-task questionnaire, and conclude with SUS questionnaire. 

### Materials
- Introduction
- Informed Consent Form
- Background Questions
- Tasks (Conducted via Lookback)
- Post-Task Questionnaire
- SUS Questionnaire

## 5-Second Test
The purpose of this study is to observe users' first impressions of the website's key pages. Participants will be shown the Home Page and the Donation page. After viewing each for five seconds, participants will be asked two questions about what they can remember.

The Home Page and Donation Page are important pages that aim to engage the community. Data from this study will provide information about the perceived engagement at first glance.

### Materials
- Image of the Home Page
- Image of the Donation Page
- 2 recall questions about each image

### Study Components: Purpose and Overview
| Webpage Image | Questions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home Page | (1) What was this webpage about? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Observe users' first impression of the start page. At first glance, does the museum effectively engage users with its identity and purpose? |
| Donation Page | (1) What action was the webpage asking you to take? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Evaluate the museum's ability to engage users through website pages. Donations are an important way for users to connect with and contribute to the museum. |
