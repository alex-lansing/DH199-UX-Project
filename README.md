# DH199 Directed Research in Digital Humanities

## Introduction
The Los Angeles area is home to many arts and culture organizations ranging in size, from the Getty Center to smaller, community-based non-profits like the Crenshaw Dairy Mart. One example is the La Historia Museum, a history nonprofit and community archive located in El Monte, California. This proposed HUE project is a collaboration with La Historia that will implement new features onto the current website to improve its usability, both from a visitor’s and staff’s perspective. This project centers on the following ideas:

1. An organization’s digital presence—via websites and social media—affects how it interacts with the community (and how the community interacts with it).
2. An organization’s website should engage the community it serves through intuitive design and accessibility.
3. Keeping turnover in mind, a website should be easy to manage and update from the perspective of the staff.

Given these ideas, the ultimate goal of the design is to add features to the website that allow visitors to interact with the archive, whether it be to donate archival materials to the digital collections or financial contributions. The target audience for this project would be community members in the El Monte area, who may range in age from middle/high school students to older residents. Since visitors may have varying familiarity with technology, accessibility is a central tenet of the proposed project. 


## Planning User Research

### Background
The purpose of this user research is to understand how organizations engage with the community through their website and social media platforms. We want to identify features that support or prevent this engagement. Further, we want to learn what might improve the usability of La Historia's website from the perspective of both visitors and the staff.

### Objectives
- Understand how organizations engage with the community through their website.
- Learn how the La Historia staff utilizes the website and what motivates them to. 
- Identify the pain points users encounter during their process and improvements for these problems.

### Participants
Participants will include individuals ranging from early teens to seniors. They must have some interest in visiting museums. Participants do not need any particular level of expertise for this study.

## Heuristic Evaluation

### 10 Usability Heuristics
Heuristic evaluation is a method that helps creators identify usability problens in a product design. The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process. This evaluation will analyze La Historia Museum's [current website](https://www.lahistoriamuseum.org).

### Severity Ratings
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Sevarity ratings for the La Historia Museum website will be measured on a scale of 0-3:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Users are unable to view what page they are on in the website. Page location shows in bold when users click to view the navigation bar. But some pages do not show in bold. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current page in navigation bar. Unhide menu; create navigation bar that is visible on all pages. |
| Match Between System and the Real World | Familiar language, icons, and footer. Slightly inconsistent navigation bar. Nav bar dropdown list is horizontal, which is inconsistent with typical menu dropdowns. | 1. Cosmetic changes needed for nav bar dropdown. | Make the dropdown list vertical. |
| User Control and Freedom | Once user visits a sub-page (from nav drop-down), the nav bar does not highlight the main page of the sub page (i.e. About Us, Projects, etc). This makes it difficult for users to go back to the corresponding main page. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current sub-page and main page so they are able to go back freely. |
| Consistency and Standards | Flat rectangular buttons are slightly inconsistent with other website buttons. They do not appear as clickable until user hovers over the button. | 1. Cosmetic changes needed for buttons. | Add dimension or other design to buttons. |
| Error Prevention | Errors are sufficiently prevented. All hyperlinks open in a new tab. "Contact Us" email ensures a proper email is entered. | 0. Satisfactory error prevention. | Satisfactory error prevention. |
| Recognition Rather Than Recall | Users are provided with relatively clear options via buttons and the menu. | 1. Cosmetic changes to nav bar and buttons. | Cosmetic design changes needed to clarify user navigation. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users have the flexibility to navigate through each page of the site via the menu. Site lacks further accessibility support. | 1. Cosmetic changes to menu. Further accessibility options needed for overall site. | Potentially unhide menu items to make them more easy to access. Provide further accessibility options. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | "In Memoriam" page: placement of images and names creates a confusing layout for the user. Sub-header text does not stand out well against paragraph text. | 2. Changes needed in layout and aesthetics. | Ensure paragraph text and headers have proper weight and sizing. Create a new layout for text and images on each page. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | When user enters an invalid email in the Contact Us section, the site does not provide a clear error message. Only states "please correct the highlighted fields". | 1. Text edit needed in error message for invalid email. | Make error message more clear. (i.e. Please enter a valid email) |
| Help and Documentation | Website lacks instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. | 2. Need further help and documentation. | Include help pop-ups or information icons that provide further details for users who need more assistance. |

### Summary of Findings
The La Historia Museum website has notable cosmetic problems. The most urgent edits needed include changes to the navigation menu. The current menu design is slightly inconsistent with other websites. Further, the menu does not properly display user's page location. Other edits are needed to improve the website layout and aesthetics. Help and documentation should also be added to make the site more accessible to a wider range of users.
