## Planning User Research

### Research Question
La Historia Museum aims to connect with its community by engaging with visitors, donors, and staff. How can we enhance this engagement through an online experience that is usable, accessible, and representative of the organization?

### Objectives
- Identify the reasons why and how often visitors and community members use the La Historia website.
- Explore web-based features that visitors feel would enhance their interactions with the organization.
- Discover any pain points in navigating the website (for visitors) and updating the website (for staff members), while being cognizant of accessibility and different familiarities with technology.
- Contextualize the website and the La Historia Museum within its organizational and community histories to explore how to center El Monteâ€™s identities (race, gender, ethnicity, ability, etc..) in our design.


### Methodology
The methodology of this study explores how we can enhance community engagement with La Historia Museum via their website. We will aggregate quantitative and qualitative research aimed to identify improvements needed on the current site. Research will consist of a Heuristic Evaluation, Competitor Analysis, Usability Testing, and 5-second Tests. The Usability Test tasks will be measured with the quantitative metrics: Average Time on Task (TOT), Success Rate, and Number of Errors. The 5-Second Tests will record users' first impressions of important pages on the museum website and help us evaluate museum-community engagement. 

The target user includes individuals located in or near El Monte, California. Target users have some interest in visiting museums and value local history. They are of various age groups, and mainly of Hispanic or Native American descent. We will focus on recruiting participants that fall under most or all these criteria. Participants do not need any particular level of expertise for this study. Participants should include individuals with varying tech experience.

The data from each test will be analyzed to identify improvements for the design of the user experience. From my findings I hope to understand how digital experiences can enhance the connection between the user and an organization. What encourages users to engage, to get involved? Further, I aim to identify effective design solutions from this research and demonstrate them in an illustrative prototype.


### Usability Test
This is a moderated, remote usability test. I, the moderator, will connect with the participant via Zoom to conduct the experiment. I will be using a Macbook Air laptop to present the survey, capture participant actions, and record participants' comments. The study will be recorded via Zoom. 

The user will recieve an introduction to the study purpose and preliminary information about the test. The user will read and complete an informed consent form before completing the survey. I will guide the user throughout the study and encourage them to recite their thought process and comments while completing the survey. After completing specified tasks, the user will provide feedback about their experience. The survey will conclude with a demographic section with questions about the user; answers in this section will be kept confidential.

### Study Tasks: Purpose and Overview

| Task | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Navigate the Projects Pages | User must navigate to the "Project" page for an overview of all three projects. Then user must locate the "My First Car" Project and identify where to submit photos to the collection. | Observe user's efficiency/ease in navigating through the menu and identifying buttons. |
| 2. Locate the page with contact information. | User must go through the menu under "About Us" to locate the "Contact Us" page. | Measure the clarity of the "Contact Us" page location. |
| 3. Read Comments on La Historia Museum's latest event. | User must locate and visit the "Events" main page. Then they must navigate to the comment section of the latest event. | Observe ease in which user can engage with the community. |


### 5-Second Test
The purpose of this study is to observe users' first impressions of the website's key pages. Participants will be shown the Home Page and the Donation page. After viewing each for five seconds, participants will be asked two questions about what they can remember.

The Home Page and Donation Page are important pages that aim to engage the community. Data from this study will provide information about the perceived engagement at first glance.

### Materials
- Image of the Home Page
- Image of the Donation Page
- 2 recall questions about each image

### Study Components: Purpose and Overview
| Webpage Image | Questions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home Page | (1) What was this webpage about? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Observe users' first impression of the start page. At first glance, does the museum effectively engage users with its identity and purpose? |
| Donation Page | (1) What action was the webpage asking you to take? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Evaluate the museum's ability to engage users through website pages. Donations are an important way for users to connect with and contribute to the museum. |
