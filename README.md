# DH199 Directed Research in Digital Humanities

## Planning User Research

### Research Question
La Historia Museum aims to preserve the narratives of El Monte residents and engage with community members. How can we enhance these goals through an online experience that is usable, accessible, and representative of the organization?

### Objectives
- Identify the reasons why and how often visitors and community members use the La Historia website.
- Explore web-based features that visitors feel would enhance their interactions with the organization.
- Discover any pain points in navigating the website (for visitors) and updating the website (for staff members), while being cognizant of accessibility and different familiarities with technology.
- Contextualize the website and the La Historia Museum within its organizational and community histories to explore how to center El Monteâ€™s identities (race, gender, ethnicity, ability, etc..) in our design.


### Methodology
The methodology of this study explores how we can enhance community engagement with La Historia Museum through their website. We will aggregate quantitative and qualitative research aimed to identify improvements needed on the current site. Research will consist of a Heuristic Evaluation, Usability Testing, and 5-second Tests. The Usability Test tasks will be measured with the quantitative metrics: Average Time on Task (TOT), Success Rate, and Number of Errors. The 5-Second Tests will help measure CTA placement and evaluate the site's community engagement.

The target user includes individuals located in or near El Monte, California. Target users have some interest in visiting museums and value local history. They are of various age groups, and mainly of Hispanic or Native American descent. We will focus on recruiting participants that fall under most or all these criteria. Participants do not need any particular level of expertise for this study. Participant set should include individuals with varying tech experience to take into consideration the broad range of target users. 

The data from each test will be analyzed to identify improvements for the design of the user experience. From my findings I hope to understand how digital experiences can enhance community engagement and narrative preservation. Further, I aim to identify effective design solutions from this research and demonstrate them in an illustrative prototype.


### Usability Test
This is a moderated, remote usability test. I, the moderator, will connect with the participant via Zoom to conduct the experiment. I will be using a Macbook Air laptop to present the survey, capture participant actions, and record participants' comments. The study will be recorded via Zoom. 

The user will recieve an introduction to the study purpose and preliminary information about the test. The user will read and complete an informed consent form before completing the survey. I will guide the user throughout the study and encourage them to recite their thought process and comments while completing the survey. After completing specified tasks, the user will provide feedback about their experience. The survey will conclude with a demographic section with questions about the user; answers in this section will be kept confidential.

### Study Tasks: Purpose and Overview

| Task | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Navigate the Projects Pages | User must navigate to the "Project" page for an overview of all three projects. Then user must locate the "My First Car" Project and identify where to submit photos to the collection. | Observe user's efficiency/ease in navigating through the menu and identifying buttons. |
| 2. Locate the page with contact information. | User must go through the menu under "About Us" to locate the "Contact Us" page. | Measure the clarity of the "Contact Us" page location. |
| 3. Read Comments on La Historia Museum's latest event. | User must locate and visit the "Events" main page. Then they must navigate to the comment section of the latest event. | Observe ease in which user can engage with the community. |


### 5-Second Test
The purpose of this study is to observe users' first impressions of the website's key pages. Participants will be shown the Home Page and the Donation page. After viewing each for five seconds, participants will be asked two questions about what they can remember.

The Home Page and Donation Page are important pages that aim to engage the community. Data from this study will provide information about the perceived engagement at first glance.

### Materials
- Image of the Home Page
- Image of the Donation Page
- 2 recall questions about each image

### Study Components: Purpose and Overview
| Webpage Image | Questions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Home Page | (1) What was this webpage about? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Observe users' first impression of the start page. At first glance, does the museum effectively engage users with its identity and purpose? |
| Donation Page | (1) What action was the webpage asking you to take? (2) What else do you remember from the webpage? | Evaluate the museum's ability to engage users through website pages. Donations are an important way for users to connect with and contribute to the museum. | 


## Heuristic Evaluation

### 10 Usability Heuristics
Heuristic evaluation is a method that helps creators identify usability problens in a product design. The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process. This evaluation will analyze La Historia Museum's [current website](https://www.lahistoriamuseum.org).

### Severity Ratings
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Sevarity ratings for the La Historia Museum website will be measured on a scale of 0-3:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Users are unable to view what page they are on in the website. Page location shows in bold when users click to view the navigation bar. But some pages do not show in bold. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current page in navigation bar. Unhide menu; create navigation bar that is visible on all pages. |
| Match Between System and the Real World | Familiar language, icons, and footer. Slightly inconsistent navigation bar. Nav bar dropdown list is horizontal, which is inconsistent with typical menu dropdowns. | 1. Cosmetic changes needed for nav bar dropdown. | Make the dropdown list vertical. |
| User Control and Freedom | Once user visits a sub-page (from nav drop-down), the nav bar does not highlight the main page of the sub page (i.e. About Us, Projects, etc). This makes it difficult for users to go back to the corresponding main page. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current sub-page and main page so they are able to go back freely. |
| Consistency and Standards | Flat rectangular buttons are slightly inconsistent with other website buttons. They do not appear as clickable until user hovers over the button. | 1. Cosmetic changes needed for buttons. | Add dimension or other design to buttons. |
| Error Prevention | Errors are sufficiently prevented. All hyperlinks open in a new tab. "Contact Us" email ensures a proper email is entered. | 0. Satisfactory error prevention. | Satisfactory error prevention. |
| Recognition Rather Than Recall | Users are provided with relatively clear options via buttons and the menu. | 1. Cosmetic changes to nav bar and buttons. | Cosmetic design changes needed to clarify user navigation. |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Users have the flexibility to navigate through each page of the site via the menu. Site lacks further accessibility support. | 1. Cosmetic changes to menu. Further accessibility options needed for overall site. | Potentially unhide menu items to make them more easy to access. Provide further accessibility options. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | "In Memoriam" page: placement of images and names creates a confusing layout for the user. Sub-header text does not stand out well against paragraph text. | 2. Changes needed in layout and aesthetics. | Ensure paragraph text and headers have proper weight and sizing. Create a new layout for text and images on each page. |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | When user enters an invalid email in the Contact Us section, the site does not provide a clear error message. Only states "please correct the highlighted fields". | 1. Text edit needed in error message for invalid email. | Make error message more clear. (i.e. Please enter a valid email) |
| Help and Documentation | Website lacks instructions that are accessible and understandable for users who need more help. | 2. Need further help and documentation. | Include help pop-ups or information icons that provide further details for users who need more assistance. |

### Summary of Findings
The La Historia Museum website has notable cosmetic problems. The most urgent edits needed include changes to the navigation menu. The current menu design is slightly inconsistent with other websites. Further, the menu does not properly display user's page location. Other edits are needed to improve the website layout and aesthetics. Help and documentation should also be added to make the site more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Competitor Analysis
I conducted a [SWOT](https://www.kickassux.com/ux-library/swot-analysis) (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of similar websites to identify what features will maximize the user experience of La Historia Museum's website. I analyzed the [Los Angeles Contemporary Archive](https://www.lacarchive.com) site and the [Autry Museum of the American West](https://theautry.org/) site.

### Los Angeles Contemporary Archive

- Archive materials filter: users can organize/filter the material to view by date acquired, artist, title name, format, publisher, venue, collections, or item location
#### Weaknesses
- Website design lacks creativity/aesthetics
- Reading Group page design is inconsistent with the rest of the website
- Advanced Search does not filter Archive materials properly
#### Opportunities
- Expanisve archive welcomes users to browse and add their own materials
- Calendar page could promote more upcoming events and present a more aesthetic experience
- Advertise more the ability for users to make appointments to visit the archive
#### Threats
- Other nonprofit websites are more aesthetically appealing to users
- Website might appear somewhat untrustworthy to users due to the lack of design
- Subscription page inconsistent with other websites; discourages users to subscribe to the email list

### Autry Museum of the American West
#### Strengths
- Consistent and coherent design throughout the website
- Side menu provides efficient navigation and clear representation of user page location
