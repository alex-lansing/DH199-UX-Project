## Heuristic Evaluation
### 10 Usability Heuristics
Heuristic evaluation is a method that helps creators identify usability problens in a product design. The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) provide criteria for user-friendly experiences, thus helping designers identify potential problems in a design and directing the overall design process. This evaluation will analyze La Historia Museum's [current website](https://www.lahistoriamuseum.org).

### Severity Ratings
Severity Ratings are used to identify the most vital problems of a design. These ratings help evaluate products in terms of their usability and design. Sevarity ratings for the La Historia Museum website will be measured on a scale of 0-3:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of System Status | Users are unable to view what page they are on in the website. Page location shows in bold when users click to view the navigation bar. But some pages do not show in bold. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current page in navigation bar. Unhide menu; create navigation bar that is visible on all pages. |
| Match Between System and the Real World | Familiar language, icons, and footer. Slightly inconsistent navigation bar. Nav bar dropdown list is horizontal, which is inconsistent with typical menu dropdowns. | 1. Cosmetic changes needed for nav bar dropdown. | Make the dropdown list vertical. |
| User Control and Freedom | Once user visits a sub-page (from nav drop-down), the nav bar does not highlight the main page of the sub page (i.e. About Us, Projects, etc). This makes it difficult for users to go back to the corresponding main page. | 2. Edits needed in navigation bar. | Highlight user's current sub-page and main page so they are able to go back freely. |


## Planning User Research
The purpose of this user research is to understand the major pain points users might experience in La Historia's current website. Findings will help identify the changes and features needed to improve the site.
